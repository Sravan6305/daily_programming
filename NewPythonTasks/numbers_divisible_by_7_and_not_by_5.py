# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# numbers = []
# for x in range(2000, 3200+1):
#     if x % 7 == 0 and x % 5 != 0:
#         numbers.append(x)
# print(numbers)


# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320

# n = int(input('enter a number: '))
# factorial = 1
#
# for i in range(1, n + 1):
#     factorial *= i
# print(factorial)
