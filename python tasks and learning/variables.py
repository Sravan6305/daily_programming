# TASK 1: Personal Info Mixer # Take the following inputs from user: # name # age # height (in meters) # Store each in separate variables
# Print # age after 5 years # height in centimeters # a single sentence using all variables

# name = 'sravan'
# age = 18
# height = 5.11
# newage = age + 5
# height_in_cm = height * 30.48
#
# print(newage)
# print(f'{height_in_cm}cm')
# print(f'hi! I am {name}. I am {newage} years old. My height is {height_in_cm}cm')


# TASK 2: Swap & Calculate # Take two numbers from user # Store them in two variables # Swap their values
# Calculate and print: # sum # difference # product

# a = 5
# b = 10
#
# c = a
# a = b
# b = c
# sum = a + b
# difference = a - b
# product = a * b
# print(a, b)
# print(f'sum, difference and product of a and b are {sum}, {difference} and {product} respectively')


# TASK 3: Bill Splitter
# Take: # total bill amount # number of people # Store them in variables
# Calculate: # amount per person # Print the result with proper message

# bill_amount = 4500
# total_people = 6
# individual_amount = bill_amount / total_people
# print(f'total bill amount is {bill_amount} and number of people are {total_people}. the individual amount is {individual_amount}')


# TASK 4: Type Detective
# Create variables of these values:
# "100"
# 10
# 100.0
# True
# Store each in a variable # Print the value and its type # Convert "100" to integer and add it to 100

# a = '100'
# b = 10
# c = 100.0
# d = True
# addition = int(a) + int(c)
#
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))
# print(type(d))
# print(addition)


# TASK 5: Time Converter
# Take total seconds as input # Store in a variable
# Convert and print: # minutes # hours

# seconds = int(input('how many seconds: '))
# minutes = seconds / 60
# hours = seconds / 3600
#
